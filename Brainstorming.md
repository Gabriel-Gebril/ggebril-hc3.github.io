# Brainstorming
- ## Matching game 
  - 3 way matching game where the user has to match name with relationship to user and their picture together.
  - Having more than one member on screen at a time might be too confusing or maybe it's exactly what would strengthen the assoication, more research needed.
  - Name at the far left, followed by relationship then a picture.
  - When you click the name u get an arrow that follows your cursor to the relationship and when you click on the relationship you get an arrow to the picture.
- ## Picture Guessing Game
  - Name and relationship is displayed at the top of the screen and the user has to guess which face below corresponds to the info given.
  - Can reshuffle the pictures and name if user having trouble.
  - Can implement multiple difficulty settings by reducing the number of pictures shown.
  - Each picture is a button for a "guess"
  - Intuitive design since each picture is a button and the buttons on top are self explanitory. This would require no explict explanation in an ideal case.
  - Easy to implement for both mobile and desktop.
  - Each screen is basically a flash card for matching a persons name and relationship with their face. This is closest to the task we want the user to be able to perform
- ## Multiple choice Flash Card
  - Each flash card is a picture and you'd have either 3 names or 3 relationships to choose from for the picture
  - Very simple quiz style application
  - Multiple difficulties are a bit harder to implement, hard mode would be more names/relationships?
  - Flash cards are a proven way to increase memory.
  - Maybe it keeps a score of how many you get right?
